    /*
    The difference between abstract class and interface:

    1.
    An abstract class permits to make functionality that subclasses can implement or override
    whereas an interface only permits to state functionality but not to implement it.

    2.
    A class can extend only one abstract class while a class can implement multiple interfaces.

    3.
    Access modifier of abstract class can be public, private and protected,
    however access modifier of inference is always public.

    4.
    Abstract class can include both abstract method and concrete method,
    however inference can only define method and cannot implement any method.
